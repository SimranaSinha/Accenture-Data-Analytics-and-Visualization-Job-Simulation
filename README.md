# Clean the data by:
- Removing rows that have values which are missing,
- Changing the data type of some values within a column, and
- Removing columns which are not relevant to this task.
     -Think about how each column might be relevant to the business question you’re investigating. If you can’t think of why a column may be 
      useful, it may not be worth including it.
